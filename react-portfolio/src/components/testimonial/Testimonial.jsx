             After working directly with Ivo nothing else to say, he exceeded all
             the expectations created not only in the part of developing automatisms, 
             brand efficiency, team management and a know how like never seen before.

            Besides his vast technical skills that include 
            Information Systems, Design and business management, Ivo also has the entrepreneurial 
            spirit and together with me launched several projects, from the management and 
            coordination of events to brand management and associated logistics. I see Ivo as one 
            of the next leaders of the new generation of top managers in Portugal.
